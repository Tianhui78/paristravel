  <h1>Paris Travel Tips You Should Know</h1>
  <p>We all know that Paris is the capital and most populous city of France. It has famous monuments like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum and Palace of Versailles. Shopping is also a to-do-thing and yes I am talking about shopping for luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, Hermes and many more. So, to all of you who are going to visit Paris for the first time or just need a recap of what to take note, hope this help you. </p>

  <p>Firstly, let's talk about accommodation, you'll find more boutique hotels rather than bigger chains and they are smaller and family-owned. You may also see a number associated with each of the hotels and they are the Arrondissement (an administrative district) starting from 1 all the way to 20. </p>
  <p>A handy tip: The last two numbers of any Paris postcode indicates the arrondissement that the location is in. For example 75001 is at the 1st arrondissement.</p>

  <p>Second, let's talk about how every arrondissement has different vibe and you can find which one would suits you!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>01 and 02 is where you can find lots of blockbuster sights, including the Louvre and Jardin des Tuileries. The whole vibe is really bustling and busy. You can totally expect a lot of tourists just like you!

    <li>03 and 04 is a pretty cool trendy neighbourhood with boutique shops, cafes, restuarants and museums.</li> 
    <li>Those who are looking to stay near Eiffel Tower, you should look at 07. Do note that there's not as many cafes and shopping around the corner but there are a lot of residential buildings.
